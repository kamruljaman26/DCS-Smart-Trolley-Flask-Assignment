# Smart Trolley

### Project Description
The Dietetics and Catering Services of a hospital is responsible for meeting the nutritional and 
dietary requirements of its patients. Food services play a crucial role in the facilitation of a 
faster recovery for patients and aiding in their treatment. The quality objectives of hospital food 
services are to provide the right food to the right patient at the right time while avoiding food 
wastage. Not only must the food provided be safe for consumption, it must also be palatable. 
To meet these objectives, heated food trolleys are used in hospitals to keep the portioned food 
trays at a desired temperature before they are delivered to the wards. As part of audit 
requirements, hospitals are required to maintain a record of food trolley temperatures before 
the food is served to patients every day.
Please design a Web application to help the hospital staff for recording the temperature of food 
trolleys. This application can reduce the time and labour needed to record temperatures of food 
trolleys, as well as improve the accuracy of the data collected.
